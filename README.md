# Bethel-Tech-Final-Project
This is my team's final project for Bethel Tech.

Our team built a lightsaber creator app. 
We used React as a front-end language.
Used Firebase and Node.js as the backend.

To view this project, download it as a ZIP file, open the file in any code editor (preferrably Visual Studio Code), open the terminal in VSC and type "npm install" then "npm start" and the application will show up in your browser.

Enjoy!
